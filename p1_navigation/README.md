# Project 1: Navigation

### Introduction

For this project, I trained an agent to navigate (and collect bananas!) in a large, square world.  

![Trained Agent][image1]

A reward of +1 is provided for collecting a yellow banana, and a reward of -1 is provided for collecting a blue banana.  Thus, the goal of your agent is to collect as many yellow bananas as possible while avoiding blue bananas.  

The state space has 37 dimensions and contains the agent's velocity, along with ray-based perception of objects around agent's forward direction.  Given this information, the agent has to learn how to best select actions.  Four discrete actions are available, corresponding to:
- **`0`** - move forward.
- **`1`** - move backward.
- **`2`** - turn left.
- **`3`** - turn right.

The task is episodic, and in order to solve the environment, your agent must get an average score of +13 over 100 consecutive episodes.

### Getting Started

1. Download the environment from one of the links below.  You need only select the environment that matches your operating system:

    - Windows (64-bit): [click here](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/udacity-drlnd/P1/Banana/Banana_Windows_x86_64.zip)
    

2. Place the file in the `p1_navigation/` folder, and unzip (or decompress) the file. Also, under the same folder I have two files that will be imported duing the excution of the notebook:

    - dqn_agent.py : Coded the Agent Class
    - model.py : Coded the DQN Network


3. For this project I used the following dependencies: 
    - torch 1.5
    - numpy 1.18
    - unityagent 0.4

### Instructions

Follow the instructions in `Navigation.ipynb` where the process of training the agent is excuted and results are shown!
